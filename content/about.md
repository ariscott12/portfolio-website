info = "I love to design interactive and intuitive digital experiences and bring them to life through front-end coding. For  me this usually involves HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Jquery and front-end tools such as grunt and browserify. As a developer and designer I am always trying to improve my skills and stay up to date on current web design trends and web development best practices by experimenting with new frameworks and continually learning through blogs and tutorials."
